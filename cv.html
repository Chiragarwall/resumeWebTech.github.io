            <li><h4><p>Research Intern (July 2023 - Oct 2023)</p></h4>
            </li>
                Worked as a research Intern under Dr. Vinay Raj, Assistant Professor at NITT. Our study involves a comprehensive exploration of how the choice of programming language can affect cold start latency within varying serverless environments. Through rigorous analysis and comparative evaluation, we aim to contribute valuable knowledge to enhance the efficiency of serverless applications.

            <h2>Projects</h2>
           <h4> <p>Network Data Visualization using Pajek             (Nov 2023)</p></h4>
            Employing Pajek for visualizing social networks arising from worker strikes enables insightful analysis. Pajek's metrics, including degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and clustering coefficients, unveil influential figures. Community detection algorithms further identify distinct subgroups, illuminating diverse agendas and affiliations within the strike network. This comprehensive analysis facilitates a deeper understanding of the dynamics fuelling strikes, strategies, and interventions effectively.


            <h4><p> Lung Cancer Classification & Detection:                                                                                             (Jan 2023)</p>
            </h4>
This mini project aimed at leveraging advanced ML techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer diagnosis. I used logistic regression and random forest classifier along with other scikit learn modules.

            <h4><p>Spelletron | An option-based Spell Correction Project                                                                    (Oct 2022)</p></h4>
            This is the mini project completely based on Python. In this project a passage is taken as input with some spell errors. My code with find all the wrongly spelled words and will provide a list of words that can be the correct alternative to that word, for e.g., Words entered was ‘wowrn’ so options can be woman, women, worm etc. The user can select the correct substitute and he will receive the passage after corrections. I have used Dynamic Edit-distance formula and other Python data structures.
